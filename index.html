# Bring Your Own User-Agent

???
Hi, I'm Chaz.

I want to talk to you about HTTP user agents.

Some time ago I had an idea and I wrote a module and put it up on CPAN.

I don't think anyone knows it exists because I didn't promote it at all. I didn't even really talk to anyone about it.
I'm not a very social person.

Anyway, I think it *might* actually be a good idea so I'm going to share it now.

## The problem.

???
So here's the problem that I wanted to solve.

![WebService modules on CPAN](img/webservice-on-cpan.png)

???

There is a whole class of so-called "web service" modules on CPAN that provide a nice perly interface for interacting
with... web services.

All kinds of things, from...

to

the Ontario Power Generation website.

class: img-map, center, middle

![WebService modules on CPAN](img/webservice-on-cpan-circled.png)

???
Most of these modules congregate here.

---
class: center, middle

## `WebService`

--
## `Net`

--
## `WWW`

---
class: center, middle

## `WebService`
## <strike>`Net`</strike>
## <strike>`WWW`</strike>

???
PSA: For new stuff, prefer the `WebService` namespace for such modules.

---
class: center, middle

## `WebService` modules are useful.

???
Even though a lot of APIs nowadays are RESTful which may be easy to use with just your favorite user agent, these
modules often take care of some of the tricky or boring details, like:

- authentication
- paging

Details that are important but you don't want to read through the API documentation to figure it out.

---
class: center, middle

## But

???
And here's the problem...

---
class: center, middle

## These modules are **tightly-coupled** to specific user agents.

![Dependencies](img/deps2.png)
![Dependencies](img/deps3.png)
![Dependencies](img/deps4.png)
![Dependencies](img/deps5.png)

???
Most of them use `LWP` or `HTTP::Tiny`.

---
class: center, middle

## This has problems.

???
Now I'm going to try to convince you that this is a problem.

---
class: center, middle

## Problem #1

### How to configure the user agent...

???
User agents typically have defaults and so may not need to be configured, but what if the user needs the user agent to
support proxying, caching, TLS, or shorter timeouts?

If the webservice package is *composing* (or wrapping) a user agent, then the webservice package needs to expose all of
the ways that the user agent can be configured.

---
class: ex-code

```perl
use WebService::Whatever;

my $ws = WebService::Whatever->new(verify_SSL => 1);

$ws->timeout(10);

my $resp = $ws->account_info;

...
```

???
So, one way this has been solved is for the webservice to expose all the attributes and knobs needed to configure the
internal agent.

But that's terrible.

---
class: ex-code

```perl
use HTTP::Tiny;
use WebService::Whatever;

my $ua = HTTP::Tiny->new(verify_SSL => 1);

*my $ws = WebService::Whatever->new(ua => $ua);

$ua->timeout(10);

my $resp = $ws->account_info;

...
```

???
So someone remembered that dependency injection was a thing, so now we have modules that let you pass in your own user
agent.

Big improvement!

---
class: ex-code

```perl
*use Mojo::UserAgent;
use WebService::Whatever;

*my $ua = Mojo::UserAgent->new(insecure => 0);

my $ws = WebService::Whatever->new(ua => $ua);

$ua->connect_timeout(10);

my $resp = $ws->account_info;       # ;-(

...
```

???
But I can't just plug in any user agent I want! If the webservice module was written for `HTTP::Tiny` or any other user
agent, it's expecting that I'm going to pass it the kind of user agent it wants.

This makes me sad.

---
class: center, middle

## Let the user decide.

???
I think the user writing a program should decide which user agent to use.

After all, they're the ones who know what the requirements of their app are.

If I'm writing a program that needs to use the least amount of resources, and I want to use a webservice that is coupled
with a *not* tiny user agent, then I'm out of luck.

Or if somebody wrote a great webservice module using a blocking interface like `HTTP::Tiny` or `LWP` that I want to use
but my program is event-driven and so can't block, then I'm out of luck again.

So then what, are we just going to write separate webservice modules for each user agent?

---

## [`Mail::SendGrid`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mail::SendGrid) -> [`HTTP::Tiny`](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny)
## [`Mojo::Sendgrid`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo::Sendgrid) -> [`Mojo::UserAgent`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo::UserAgent)
## [`WebService::SendGrid`](https://metacpan.org/pod/WebService::SendGrid) -> [`Net::Curl::Simple`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Curl::Simple)

???
Yeah, that's exactly what's up.

What we need is user agent adapter (as in the adapter pattern).

Something that has an inteface that module writers can code against and then translates the request and response
appropriately for whatever real user agent is provided.

---

## [`HTTP::Any`](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Any)

???
I searched CPAN and found just such a thing!

--
#### But it has fatal flaws...

???
in my opinion. (No offense to this module's author.)

--
### 1. It provides its own *new* interface.

???
- And nobody wants to learn yet another user agent interface.
- And it's a callback interface in order to support non-blocking user agents,

But having to set callback functions if you're not actually using a non-blocking user agent is kinda clunky.

--
### 2. It doesn't support many user agents.

???
only `LWP`, `AnyEvent`, and `Curl`.

--
### 3. It doesn't actually provide a common interface.

???
so it's not really usable as an adapter.

---
class: center, middle

## I wrote a module to fix these problems.

---
class: center, middle

## [`HTTP::AnyUA`](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::AnyUA)

???
This one is different because it has a "UA" at the end.

It's also a true HTTP user agent adapter providing a common interface.

---
## [`HTTP::AnyUA`](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::AnyUA)

### 1. Uses the `HTTP::Tiny` interface.

???
- So not much new to learn.
- And you don't have to use callbacks if your user agent is non-blocking.

--
### 2. Supports at least six user agents.

.col[
- [`AnyEvent::HTTP`](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent::HTTP)
- [`Furl`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Furl)
- [`HTTP::Tiny`](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny)
]
.col[
- [`LWP::UserAgent`](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent)
- [`Mojo::UserAgent`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo::UserAgent)
- [`Net::Curl::Easy`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Curl::Easy)
]

???
Plus any user agent that inherits from any of these in a well-behaved manner should also work.

--
### 3. Provides a *common* interface.

???
which, like I said, is the `HTTP::Tiny` interface.

---
class: ex-code

```perl
has ua => (
    is       => 'ro',
    required => 1,
);

has any_ua => (
    is       => 'lazy',
    default  => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        require HTTP::AnyUA;
        HTTP::AnyUA->new(ua => $self->ua);
    },
);
```

???
A webservice module implementing this looks something like this.
- Allow the user to pass in a useragent. You could also default to `HTTP::Tiny` or something if you wanted the attribute
  to be optional.
- Then you construct an `HTTP::AnyUA` instance and pass it the useragent.

---
class: ex-code

```perl
sub account_info {
    my $self = shift;

*   my $resp = $self->any_ua->get(
        $self->base_url . '/account',
        {
            headers => {
                authorization => $self->auth,
            },
        },
    );

    return $resp;
}
```

???
The webservice methods then use the `HTTP::AnyUA` to make requests using the same args and response that `HTTP::Tiny`
has.

---
class: ex-code

```perl
my $ua = HTTP::Tiny->new;

my $ws = WebService::Whatever->new(ua => $ua);

my $resp = $ws->account_info;
```

???
A **user** of the webservice module would look like this.

You just provide the useragent to the webservice.

---
class: ex-code

```perl
my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;

my $ws = WebService::Whatever->new(ua => $ua);

my $resp = $ws->account_info;
```

---
class: ex-code

```perl
my $ua = Mojo::UserAgent->new;

my $ws = WebService::Whatever->new(ua => $ua);

my $resp = $ws->account_info;
```

---
class: ex-code

```perl
my $ua = 'AnyEvent::HTTP';

my $ws = WebService::Whatever->new(ua => $ua);

my $resp = $ws->account_info;
```

---
class: ex-code

```perl
my $ua = 'AnyEvent::HTTP';

my $ws = WebService::Whatever->new(ua => $ua);

my $resp = $ws->account_info;

# {
#     success => 1,
#     url     => "https://whatever/account"
#     status  => 200,
#     reason  => "OK",
#     content => "{...}",
#     headers => {...},
# }
```

???
The response from `HTTP::AnyUA` always looks like an `HTTP::Tiny` response, regardless of which user agent the user
provides.

In this case, my "whatever" webservice is just passing the raw response back to the user, but a more useful service will
decode the response content.

And, in the case that the user provides a non-blocking user agent, then instead of returning a hashref with the normal
`HTTP::Tiny` response, it returns a `Future` object that resolves to a hashref with the normal `HTTP::Tiny` response. So
you know what to expect.

![HTTP::AnyUA diagram](img/http-anyua-diagram.svg)

???
I think this is pretty cool already, but I'll show you one more thing before I get kicked off that's even cooler...

---
class: center, middle

![HTTP::AnyUA with middleware diagram](img/http-anyua-middleware-diagram.svg)

???
You can write components that work for any user agent and plug them in. I've written only a couple such components, one
to time the request takes and another to ensure a proper 'content-length' header is set.

Middleware components can do anything, even short-circuit and not actually call the user agent.

I started writing a caching component. This middleware is taking me awhile to write because I want it to be
`RFC-7234`-compliant (and my interest jumps around), but it would be cool because not every user agent has a decent
cache.

With HTTP::AnyUA, I just need to implement the cache once and it works for all of them.

---
class: center, middle

## Conclusion

???
If you're writing a module that needs to *use* an HTTP user agent but otherwise has no reason to prefer one over
another, consider using `HTTP::AnyUA` or something like it.
